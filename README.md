Automatic youtube video transcription

Just a quick script to clean up the transcription as copied from any youtube video.

I wrote this in 2019 as a learning project, it might be of use to someone just starting out.
## Possible Future Development Ideas
----
* Automatically scrape the youtube transcription from URL using Beautiful Soup library
* Use a library like nltk to cleanup the grammar, and format into paragraphs. 
* Currently using Tkinter, KivyMD would give modern design look.
